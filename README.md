Test-Level-Editor
=================

A very simple level editor for a test platformer I was messing around with.

This was created a LOOOOOONG time ago. I have no idea if it even compiles anymore (it probably doesn't).
It's also extremely inefficient for anyting above a small map size due to the main tiling algorithm working in O(n^2) time (at least).

While this was a great learning exercise at the time, I recommend anyone looking for a tile map generator to use something like the fully featured (and quite frankly AWESOME) [Tiled](https://github.com/bjorn/tiled) editor.
